üöÄ Excited to share my latest project deployment on AWS using Terraform! üõ†Ô∏è

I've successfully set up an Auto Scaling Group, CloudWatch alarms, Launch Template, Application Load Balancer, S3 Bucket, CloudFront distribution, Security Group, VPC, and more, all to deploy a web application seamlessly. üíª

Here's a breakdown of what's included:
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Ensures that my application can handle varying traffic loads by automatically adjusting the number of instances.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Monitors key metrics and triggers actions to maintain application health and performance.
- **Launch Template**: Provides a blueprint for launching EC2 instances with specified configurations.
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, improving scalability and fault tolerance.
- **S3 Bucket**: Stores and serves static assets efficiently.
- **CloudFront**: Accelerates content delivery by caching static and dynamic content at edge locations worldwide.
- **Security Group**: Acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic to my instances.
- **VPC**: Provides a virtual network environment where all the resources are deployed securely.

I've documented the entire infrastructure setup in the `backend.tf` file, making it easy to replicate and modify for different projects. You can find the codebase and configurations in my GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RAM28EC/Terrform-aws-cloudfront.git)

Excited to hear your feedback and thoughts on this deployment approach! Let's continue building robust and scalable applications on AWS together. üí™ #AWS #Terraform #CloudInfrastructure #DevOps #DeploymentAutomation #GitHub #CloudComputing
